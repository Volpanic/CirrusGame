# Cirrus 
A simple platformer based in Monogame, currently not much of a game just a basic level editor.

**Future plans for Editor**
Accurate map scrolling (Insead of just displaying to whole level on screen)
Entity placing and editing tool,
Saving and loading maps,
basic event script (or just list of commands to pick from)(Similar to Cave Story's [TSC](https://www.cavestory.org/guides/basicmodding/guide/tsc.html) ) 

Running the game at this point won't do much, mainly because right now the editor is the main focus, running the game in editor will load the made level into the game.
